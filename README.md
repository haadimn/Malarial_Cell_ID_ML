# Malarial_Cell_ID_ML

Malaria is a deadly epidemic that is caused by parasites which are transmitted through infected mosquitoes. Even though the
disease can be cured, rapid detection is extremely important for the treatment of patients. In this project, we explore the detection
of infected cells with convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms. The aim of this project is to learn the basics of machine
learning and apply the knowledge acquired during the UCSCIPHYL6 lab course. Using the Tensorflow Keras API, and
preexisting malarial cell images, we program a CNN with a 96% accuracy in identifying parasitized cells
